This repository is serves as the archive of code for a project analysing fractal scaling of interaction time series in a French public organisation (Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS)).
The aim of the project was to investigate fractal scaling of the interaction frequencies within the three biggest departments in terms of overall number of interactions, as well as across the whole organisation.  For this analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis was used. 
Furthermore, several measures of network structure were analysed to investigate the correlation between network structure and fractal scaling.
